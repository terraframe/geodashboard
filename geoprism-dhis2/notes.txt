TODO:
1) Assign program to org units
2) Why can't I see the data in tracker?
3) Synonyms??


Corner Cases:
1) If you create a new category list in our app it won't populate over into DHIS2
2) Attribute already exists? (all attribute imports fail, transactional)




Notes for DHIS2 devs:

1) Metadata exporter does not respect query/filter criteria:
https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/developer/html/webapi_working_with_metadata_api.html


https://play.dhis2.org/demo/api/metadata?assumeTrue=false&organisationUnits=true&id=Rp268JB6Ne4

This query I would expect to return only one org unit, but it returns all of them.


2) NOTE: THIS MAY NOT APPLY TO STANDARD IMPORTERS AND ONLY THE METADATA IMPORTER?? The response from a successful 'create' action should return the serialized created object. The reason for this is because I need the id of that newly created object to reference in further requests.





3) You're allowed to create a program through the metadata API without any attributes (the 'programTrackedEntityAttributes' json key is missing), but then trying to fetch programs [http://127.0.0.1:8085/api/25/metadata?assumeTrue=false&programs=true] produces error:
{"httpStatus":"Internal Server Error","httpStatusCode":500,"status":"ERROR","message":"null index column for collection: org.hisp.dhis.program.Program.programAttributes"}

This error does not happen when a program is created with an empty programTrackedEntityAttributes array []

4) I got a little confused try to create a program using the API because the programTrackedEntityAttributes require a program id, but I can't get the programId till after I've created the program, which requires an array of these attributes. As you can see there's a circular dependency issue here.
I got it working by first creating the attributes then the program, but I don't know if these program attributes don't have a programId reference and if this may cause errors later on.

5) NOTE: IN THE REGULAR API YOU MUST SPECIFY AN ORG UNIT. Tracked entity instances don't seem to export from the metadata service
